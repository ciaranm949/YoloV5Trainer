## Project Dependencies Installation

1. **Install the project dependencies:**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Clone the YOLOv5 repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
```

3. **Install YOLOv5 dependencies:**

```

## Usage

To use this you will need a dataset in YOLOv5 format
That is, a directory of images, split into train, valid, and test directories, along with text files where each line contains information about the object's class label and bounding box coordinates relative to the image size.
Datasets can be downloaded or built from [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/)

## Dataset

This project was set up in particular to use this dataset
